# Properwatcher: AWS lambda tutorial

This tutorial covers how you can use the properwatcher tool to monitor different property websites with the use of an AWS free tier setup. It will guide you through setting up a lambda function and show you how to create a scheduled trigger, so that property portals get searched continuously. Afterwards, you will learn how to use a DynamoDb database to persist and deduplicate entries. Eventually, you will learn how to configure properwatcher to send out notifications via mail, once new properties are found.
